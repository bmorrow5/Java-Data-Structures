DESIGN: 
This program is designed to be run from the command line to convert from prefix to postfix. It converts 
from prefix to postfix recursively. It also has a readLine method that reads through
each line recursively converting from prefix to postfix while error checking. The readLine method has the
added feature of working with files from a linux OS.
